          <h2>Meet Naomi</h2>
          <p><strong>Naomi Howard</strong> a 50-year-old constitutional defense attorney and lifelong Texan from Waco, is running for Mayor of Arlington to bring a fresh, problem-solving perspective to the city's most pressing issues: the city budget gap, the unchecked proliferation of rental properties, and the desperate need for effective public transportation. Though she has never held public office, her extensive legal career has uniquely prepared her to lead.
</p>
<p>Throughout her career, Howard has demonstrated a commitment to justice and innovative problem-solving. She has successfully argued for striking down a state criminal statute as unconstitutional, litigated prisoner civil rights cases, and defended elected officials. This wide variety of cases fuels her creativity and compels her to think about new, systemic approaches to reform within the criminal justice system‚Äîa critical skill she will bring to city hall.
</p>
<p>
  Beyond her practice, Howard has served on the board of the Innocence Project of Texas for five years and was recently elected as the board's Vice President, dedicated to overturning wrongful convictions. In her downtime, she enjoys hiking, cooking Japanese food, and unwinding with a Scandinavian crime drama on Netflix.
  <p>Howard believes her experience as an advocate who fights for fundamental rights and looks for creative, systemic solutions is exactly what Arlington needs to close the budget deficit, ensure balanced neighborhood development, and finally build a viable public transit system.</p>
</p>
          <p>Howard runs her own solo constitutional defense practice in Austin, specializing in trial and appellate advocacy in the state and federal criminal justice systems. Before that, she was a litigator at the prestigious firm Rusty Hardin & Associates in Houston, where she handled a diverse caseload including state and federal criminal matters and administrative agency cases. Her legal acumen is fortified by her experience clerking for the Honorable Bert Richardson of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in Austin, an experience that gave her deep insight into the judicial process, particularly concerning the death penalty.</p>

          <ul class="platform-list">

            <li><strong>Short-Term Fiscal Realism:</strong> While not an ideal long-term solution, short-term tax increases may be necessary to stabilize our finances and protect core services.</li>
            <li><strong>Long-Term Efficiency and Innovation:</strong> Naomi will immediately create a bipartisan Community Efficiency Task Force‚Äîstaffed by diverse stakeholders‚Äîto rigorously audit city operations, eliminate operational waste, and find creative, sustainable solutions for more efficient service delivery.</li>

          <p><strong>Naomi Howard's Plan for Balanced Growth:</strong></p>
          <ul class="platform-list">
            <li><strong>Immediate Legal Review:</strong> As a lawyer and a resident who chose Arlington, Naomi knows we must act now. She will prioritize an immediate, aggressive review of the city's outdated zoning laws to find fast, effective legal solutions that can increase supply and stabilize prices.</li>
            <li><strong>A Clear Vision for the Future:</strong> The city's growth cannot be haphazard. Naomi will lead the development of a strong, community-driven mission statement for future city planning. This foundational document will ensure that all future development is strategic, balanced, and protects the unique character and affordability of every Arlington neighborhood.</li>
